My name is Adam Charette-Castonguay and I'm a Phd student at Monash University. I study within the Graduate Research Indisciplinary Program (GRIP). My research concerns the simulation of the transition of urbna water systems using agent-based modelling. The model I'm developing will feed into the [Dance4Water platform](http://dance4water.org/). I'm also involved in testing the [Water Sensitive City index](http://dance4water.org/interactive_index/) in cities of Asia-Pacific in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank. 
   
## My research interests revolve around:

* Ecosystem services
* Ecological economics
* Resilience, vulnerability and adapatability
* Social-environmental and socio-technical modelling
* Working in developing countries
